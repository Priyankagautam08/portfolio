## Projects

### GNN Based Criticality Analysis in Interdependent critical infrastructure
[Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10520547)

Developed a scalable, adaptable framework using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify critical nodes/links in interconnected infrastructure networks. Incorporated performance-based feature metrics alongside traditional network-based metrics (like degree and eigenvector centrality) for vulnerability assessment. Achieved high accuracy in node (92.34% to 97.24%) and link (98.64% to 99.01%) classification using the CLARC dataset, demonstrating the efficacy of GNNs in pinpointing critical nodes and links.

### A Transductive Graph Neural Network learning for Grid Resilience Analysis
[Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10333912)

Developed a novel approach using transductive Graph Neural Network (GNN) learning to enhance power grid resilience by identifying critical nodes and links. The GNN-based method leverages the grid's graph structure and operational data to learn resilience metrics, outperforming traditional simulation-based methods. Demonstrated the approach's efficacy through case studies on node criticality and cascading outages, highlighting its scalability and accuracy.

### ARISE Kansas NSF EPSCoR

As a Graduate Research Assistant on the ARISE (Adaptive and Resilient Infrastructures driven by Social Equity) project, I focus on developing scalable Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. My work aims to pinpoint critical nodes and links within Kansas' infrastructure systems to ensure resilience and robustness. Additionally, I handle uncertainty quantification for disasters and hazards, contributing to the project's goal of enhancing infrastructure resilience with a strong emphasis on social equity. This NSF-funded initiative integrates multidisciplinary research to support vulnerable communities in Kansas.
