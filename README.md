## 🏗️ Projects  

### **🔹 GNN-Based Criticality Analysis in Infrastructure Networks**  
📜 **[Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10520547)**  
✔ Identified **critical nodes & links** in **urban infrastructure**  
✔ Achieved **97%+ accuracy** using GNNs  
Developed a scalable, adaptable framework using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify critical nodes/links in interconnected infrastructure networks. Incorporated performance-based feature metrics alongside traditional network-based metrics (like degree and eigenvector centrality) for vulnerability assessment. Achieved high accuracy in node (92.34% to 97.24%) and link (98.64% to 99.01%) classification using the CLARC dataset, demonstrating the efficacy of GNNs in pinpointing critical nodes and links.

### **🔹 Transductive GNN Learning for Power Grid Resilience**  
📜 **[Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10333912)**  
✔ Developed **scalable GNN models** for **grid failure prediction**  
✔ Improved prediction speed **2× over traditional methods**  
Developed a novel approach using transductive Graph Neural Network (GNN) learning to enhance power grid resilience by identifying critical nodes and links. The GNN-based method leverages the grid's graph structure and operational data to learn resilience metrics, outperforming traditional simulation-based methods. Demonstrated the approach's efficacy through case studies on node criticality and cascading outages, highlighting its scalability and accuracy.
